<h1>Cafe Menu</h1>
My second project. A simple coffee menu. I learned the basics of CSS by building this.

My biggest challenge was understanding how to manipulate CSS styles. There's so many different properties and ways to choose colors! My favorite concept was shadow box. Definitely going to use it in future projects. I also made the rookie mistake of not pushing the project to Github until it was finished. That's why there's no commit history.
